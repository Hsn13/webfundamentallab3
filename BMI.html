            <h2>BMI</h2>
            <p>BMI is a useful measure of overweight and obesity. It is calculated from
                your height and weight. BMI is an estimate of body fat and a good gauge 
                of your risk for diseases that can occur with more body fat.
                The higher your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases such as 
                heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing 
                problems and certain cancers. Although BMI can be used for most men and women,
                it does have some limits: it may overestimate body fat in athletes and others
                who have a muscular build. It may underestimate body fat in older persons
                and others who have lost muscle. Use the BMI Calculator ot BMI tables
                to estimate your body fat. The BMI score means the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Below 18.5: Underweight</li>
                    <li>18.5-24.9: Normal</li>
                    <li>25.0-29.9: Overweight</li>
                    <li>30.0 and above: Obese</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <h2>Waist Circumference</h2>
                <p>Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks
                    that come with overweight and obesity. If most of your fat is around your
                    waist rather than at your hips, you are at a higher risk for heart disease
                    and type 2 diabetes. The risk goes up with a waist size that is greater 
                    than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. 
                    To correctly measure your waist, stand and place a tape measure around 
                    your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your waist just after
                    you breathe out.</p><!-- Your BMI description goes here -->
